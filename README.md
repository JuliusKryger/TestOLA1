# 1 REFLECTIONS
## 1.1 SHOOTING

### A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. Here are the possible reasons:

    1. The bullet missed the man.
    2. The man was wearing a bulletproof vest.
    3. The bullet hit a non-vital area.
    4. The gun malfunctioned and didn't fire the bullet as expected.

## 1.2 ALIEN

### To teach an alien how to brush its teeth, follow these steps:

    1. Stand in front of a sink or a basin.
    2. Take a toothbrush using your dominant hand.
    3. With your other hand, open a tube of toothpaste.
    4. Turn the toothpaste cap anti-clockwise to open.
    6. Gently squeeze the toothpaste tube, placing a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto the bristles.
    7. Close the toothpaste tube by turning the cap clockwise.
    8. Wet the toothbrush slightly under running water.
    10. Place the toothbrush in your mouth, brush against your teeth.
    11. Brush using small circular motions, covering all surfaces of each tooth.
    12. Brush for a total of two minutes, ensuring you brush the outer, inner, and chewing surfaces of each tooth.
    13. Spit out the toothpaste.
    14. Rinse your mouth with water.
    15. Rinse your toothbrush under running water.
    16. Store the toothbrush in an upright position to let it dry.

# 3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD
### What was positive and good about using TDD?

I'm instead going to mention things that i think testing could be good for or a positive outcome from doing tests.

    1. Clarity: TDD provides a clear understanding of what the function or component is supposed to do.
    2. Robustness: It ensures that the code works before any further development, making the software more robust.
    3. Ease of Refactoring: With tests already in place, refactoring is safer and easier.
    4. Incremental Progress: Ensures small increments of development, which makes tracking progress and identifying issues easier.

### What was annoying or difficult?

    1. Setup in a bigger project: The initial setup for TDD can feel like an big task, especially for simple tasks.
    2. Learning Curve: For those new to TDD, there's a learning curve involved.

### What surprised you?

    I'm honestly not sure, haven't really done much TDD, besides this simple assignment right now. And i don't feel like it is enough to really comment on that.

### Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?

    The answer is pretty much going to be the same as above, i don't feel like we have done enough yet to really comment on this yet.
